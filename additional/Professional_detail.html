    <h2>DIAMOND PLATE</h2>
    <h3>S/M and L/XL CARS $250</h3>

    <p class="diamond">Diamond Plate is a nano ceramic polymer coating that reacts with your vehicle’s clear coat finish
      to form a
      second
      layer and thicker coating for added protection. These coatings are so durable that they are used widely in the
      aerospace industry. Three independent laboratory tests have proven that Diamond Plate will last well beyond 2
      years
      on your vehicle’s surface.
      <br><br>
      Diamond Plate protects against:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acid rain</li>
      <li>Bird droppings</li>
      <li>Insects</li>
      <li>Hard water spots</li>
      <li>Exposure to the sun causing fading, chalking, and loss of gloss</li>
    </ul>
